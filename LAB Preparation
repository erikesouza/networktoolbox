Each student will receive a new AWS account with 02 VPCs one at us-east-1 and another at sa-east-1
You can deploy the VPCs and instances trough CloudFormation Templates

OBSERVATION: Before running these templates, log into the account and create and download two key-keypairs:
@us-east-1: Key-pair name: bs-net-admin
@sa-east-1: Key-pair name: bs-saopaulo 
Use your preferred stack name â€“ I used bs-net205
There is no dependency between the templates. You can run both at the same time
